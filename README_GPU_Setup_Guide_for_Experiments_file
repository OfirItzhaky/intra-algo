# ‚ö° GPU Setup Guide for Intra Algo (Windows)

This guide explains how to enable **TensorFlow GPU acceleration** on **Windows** for use with the Intra Algo platform.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Use GPU?

GPU acceleration significantly improves the speed of training deep learning models like CNNs.
TensorFlow will automatically use the GPU if properly installed and configured.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Checklist

| Requirement            | Status |
|------------------------|--------|
| ‚úÖ NVIDIA GPU (RTX etc) | Yes    |
| ‚úÖ Python 3.10           | Required |
| ‚úÖ TensorFlow 2.10.0     | Required |
| ‚úÖ DirectML Plugin       | Optional (used here) |
| ‚úÖ NVIDIA GPU Driver     | Up to date (check `nvidia-smi`) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps

### 1. ‚úÖ Install Python 3.10

Download and install from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/

Make sure to **add Python to PATH** during setup.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Create New Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.10 -m venv dml_33venv


## ‚ö†Ô∏è GPU Crash Fix (zlibwapi.dll Missing)

If you encounter a crash like:
Could not locate zlibwapi.dll. Please make sure it is in your library path!
Process finished with exit code -1073740791 (0xC0000409)


This means TensorFlow requires `zlibwapi.dll` for GPU computation but couldn't find it.

### üõ†Ô∏è Solution:

1. Download `zlibwapi.dll` from a trusted source such as:
   https://www.dll-files.com/zlibwapi.dll.html

2. Place the DLL in:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\` (or another folder listed in your system's `PATH`)

3. Restart PyCharm and your machine if needed.

After this fix, TensorFlow will be able to use the GPU without crashing.
